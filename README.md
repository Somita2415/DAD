msfvenom_wrapper project!!
The Metasploit Framework (MSF) is a popular open source security framework used for penetration testing. 
The msfvenom wrapper is a tool that can be used to quickly generate payloads for the Metasploit Framework. 
It allows users to easily generate payloads for use in the Metasploit Framework without needing to manually create the payloads themselves.

To create a wrapper around msfvenom,
you will first need to write a script that sets up the msfvenom command line with any required arguments and options. 
You can then add logic to the script that allows it to interact with the user, such as prompting for input and providing feedback. 
Once the script is complete, you can either store it on your system for easy access or make it available for others to use.
